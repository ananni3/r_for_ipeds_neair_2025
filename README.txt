The demo during the session will use two sets of files.

When using the sample code, put the data in a folder named “Data” in the working directory.

The demo of creating an uploadable file uses these two files: 
ipeds_uploadable_creation.R
Sample_dataset.xlsx

The demo of validation uses these three files: 
IPEDS_fall_enrollment_validation.Rmd
Cleaned_Sample_dataset.xlsx
Cleaned_Sample_dataset_previous_year.xlsx

"Cleaned_" datasets are created by the ipeds_uploadable_creation.R.

If you're just getting started with R, start by installing R and RStudio.
